/*
  Triangle Project Code.

  Triangle analyzes the lengths of the sides of a triangle
  (represented by a, b and c) and returns the type of triangle.
 
  It returns:
    'equilateral'  if all sides are equal
    'isosceles'    if exactly 2 sides are equal
    'scalene'      if no sides are equal
 
  The tests for this method can be found in
    about_triangle_project.py
  and
    about_triangle_project_2.py
